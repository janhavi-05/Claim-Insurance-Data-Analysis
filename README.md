# Claim-Insurance-Data-Analysis
In this machine learning project, we aim to leverage advanced analytical techniques to extract meaningful insights and predictions from a given dataset. Through a systematic process of exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and modeling, our objective is to develop a robust predictive model that enhances decision-making and understanding within the target domain.
Problem Statement Dataset Name - Car Insurance Claim Prediction https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ifteshanajnin/carinsuranceclaimprediction-classification

Dataset Info - The Dataset contains information on policyholders having the attributes like policy tenure, age of the car, age of the car owner, the population density of the city, make and model of the car, power, engine type, etc, and the target variable indicating whether the policyholder files a claim in the next 6 months or not.

Data Size - 58592 rows and 44 columns Target Variable - Predict whether the policyholder will file a claim in the next 6 months or not. There is a boolean column - is_claim which tells whether the insurance was claimed or not. Our aim is to train the model to predict this given rest of the information. So, basically it is a binary classification problem.

Proposed Solution In this machine learning project, the analysis begins with a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, aimed at gaining insights into the dataset's structure, distributions, and potential patterns. Following the EDA, the focus shifts to data preprocessing, where critical steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and addressing outliers are undertaken to ensure the data is appropriately formatted for modeling. A key element of this preprocessing stage involves feature selection, wherein relevant features are identified to enhance model performance and reduce dimensionality using correlation matrix and PCA. Subsequently, normalization is applied to standardize the feature values, ensuring that each variable contributes uniformly to the model, thereby preventing any single feature from disproportionately influencing the results. Finally, the modeling phase involves selecting and training machine learning models on the preprocessed data, evaluating their performance, and fine-tuning as necessary to achieve the optimal predictive outcomes. This systematic approach, from EDA to normalization and feature selection, culminates in the development of a robust and effective machine learning model for the given dataset.
